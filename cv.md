## About Me 

I am a motivated individual with a passion for web development, and I am eager to transition into a career as a front-end developer. Through completing various courses and trainings, including HTML Academy, FreeCodeCamp, and currently studying at rsschool, I have developed a solid foundation in web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With my previous experience as a lead geologist and deputy chief, I have developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills, which I believe will be valuable in my transition into a career in web development.

## Code Example
```
  const charCount = {};
   const arrayWord = word.toLowerCase().split('')
   const newArray =[]
   for (let i = 0; i < arrayWord.length; i++) {
    if (charCount[arrayWord[i]]) {
      charCount[arrayWord[i]]++;
    } else {
      charCount[arrayWord[i]] = 1;
    }
  }
  for (let i = 0; i < arrayWord.length; i++) {
    if (charCount[arrayWord[i]] > 1) {
      newArray.push (')')
    } else {
      newArray.push('(')
    }
    
  }
  return newArray.join('')
  }
